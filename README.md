# Homework 4: Redux Blog

[Link to my blog](myblog.surge.sh)

In this homework I rolled my own blog platform using react+redux.

## What worked
- Everything (routing, API calls, views, etc)


## What didn't
- Everything broke when I misspelled "receive" in willReceiveProps... whoops

## Extra Credit
- Made it look pretty using Bootstrap+SASS
- Fetches random images from Flickr to go along with the blog post based on the post's tags
